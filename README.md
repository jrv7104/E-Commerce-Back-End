E-Commerce Back End

This is a work in progress E-Commerce Back End project. The idea is to see the files with product information, categories and tags and id. In addition to seeding the information the API routes would allow users to create new categories, products and tags along with deleting, viewing or updating the items.

This ended up being a massive challenge, and as I already mentioned it is a work in progress, so I do plan on resubmitting it when I get the help needed to get it fully functioning. I had three things working against me on this project.

1) I am not familiar with Insomnia at all, and it was briefly mentioned, then it felt like the program was used in class, but it felt like I could never understand how to use it properly.

2) The week's lessons for this project I was completely lost, and not only did I not want to slow down the class, but I didn't know what questions to ask about it other than just simply asking "What?..." as opposed to a fully formed question. I did review the content before this assignment and used the lessons as a guide, and I feel like I did better than I thought despite it not fully functioning yet. It was better than being completely lost and not having anything to show for it.

3) The thing that also hurt was that I planned on getting help from my tutor for this assignment, but a family emergency popped up from his end and he cancelled right before our meeting. If I knew about the possibility of getting a substitute tutor for the week I definitely would have pursued that option.

It is a little disappointing it will be an incomplete assignment for the second straight week, but I feel like I'm almost there with this assignment (and the previous one), so I hope with some more help I'll be able to resubmit it when it's done. As it is I wanted to show how much I got accomplished and see about any possible feedback.
