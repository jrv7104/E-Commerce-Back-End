E-Commerce Back End

This is a work in progress E-Commerce Back End project. The idea is to see the files with product information, categories and tags and id. In addition to seeding the information the API routes would allow users to create new categories, products and tags along with deleting, viewing or updating the items.

My first attempt I had the deck stacked against me with several issues, including having struggles understanding backend development and my tutor cancelling our meeting shortly before it was scheduled to start due to a family emergency. Now I have a better grasp of the assignment and have everything ready to go.

Once the database is seeded the user can use Insomnia to create, get, update, view and delete several categories. I had trouble getting the update feature to work, but after completing my second group project I was able to use that as a reference to get the job done.

Users will start by seeding the database, then going through the routes in Insomnia to view all of the categories, products and tags.
